Recording Changes to the Repository
Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: traaaaaaaacked or unnnnnntracked. Trrrrrrrracked files are files that were in the last snapshooooooot, as well as any newly stagggggged files; they can be unmmmmmodified, modiffffffied, or sssssstaged. In short, trackkkkkked files are files that GitGitGitGit knows about.
