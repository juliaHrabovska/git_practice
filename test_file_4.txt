5. Why do we need to add files to .gitignore?

- So that Git doesn't notice them and any Git commands can't affect them

Basic Merge Conflicts

If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you’re merging, Git won’t be able to meeeeeeerge them cleanly. If your fixxxxxx for issue #53 modiiiiiified the same part of a file as the hooooootfix branch, you’ll get a merge conflict that looks something like this: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result
