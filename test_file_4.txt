Basic Merge Conflicts
If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two braaaaaaanches you’re merging, GitGitGitGitGit won’t be able to meeeeeeerge them cleanly. If your fix for issue #53 modiiiiiified the same part of a file as the hooooootfix branch, you’ll get a merge conffffffflict that looks something like this: CONFLICT (conteeeeeent): Merge conflict in index.html Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result
