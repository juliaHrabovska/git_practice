- This is the output of the git diff command

4. How to make a commit?

- Make changes to files and list them after git commit. For example: git commit a.file, b.file
- Make changes, compile these changes with the command "git add" or "git commit -a" and specify the commit message after the "-m" switch
- You can’t commit, because there is no such thing

- The more often the better
- Always when creating a commit
- Always after git pull
- Only if you need to find out what status the repository is in, otherwise this command is not mandatory for any manipulation

When you make a commmmmmmmmit, GitGitGitGitGit stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshoooooot of the content you staggggggged. This object also contains the authoooooor’s name and email addrrrrrrrress, the messsssssssage that you typed, and poinnnnnnnters to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent or parents): zero parents for the inittttttttial commit, one parent for a normal commit, and multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more braaaaaaanches.
