Branches
When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged. This object also contains the authorâ€™s name and email address, the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent for a normal commit, and multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.
